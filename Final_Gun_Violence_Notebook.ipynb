    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Media Attention Bias**: Mass shootings gathers a lot of media attention, and therefore more data tracked. Making sure we differentiate between gun violence that happens every day while accounting for these specific incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsistent Reporting**: There might not be consistent reporting across the United States. States with large urban areas such as New York City, Chicaho, Miami, Los Angelos, may experience higher rates of gun violence possibly skewing available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Legal Nuances**: Comprehending the complexities of gun laws is challenging, especially without a legal background. Analyzing gun violence data requires a broad perspective to navigate the legal landscape effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public perception and bias**: Gun violence and gun laws are highly sensitive topics influenced by public perception and bias. Political and geographical factors can shape opinions, leading to controversies surrounding the interpretation of data. Acknowledging and addressing these biases is crucial for an objective analysis."
