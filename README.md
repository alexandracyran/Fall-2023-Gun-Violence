**Authors:** Megha Idicula, Alexandra Cyran, Victoria Lance Kominek

## Purpose
This repository explores the intricate relationship between individuals charged with gun violence and mental illness, with a spotlight on variations in gun laws across states, particularly in Connecticut, and examines state-specific mortality rates associated with firearm incidents. Gun violence is a pressing issue in the United States, prompting an examination of its connection to mental illness. Diverse data sources, including Kaggle, CDC, and the State Firearm Law Database, contribute to a comprehensive analysis. The central question of this research revolves around the granting of gun licenses to individuals with a history of mental illness. 

## Research Topics
-Mental health factors in mass shootings
-Impact of substance abuse on gun violence
-Geographic variations in gun violence. 
-The relationship between gun laws and firearm mortality rates


## Challenges & Lessons Learned:
**Media Attention Bias:** Mass shootings gathers a lot of media attention, and therefore more data tracked. Making sure we differentiate between gun violence that happens every day while accounting for these specific incidents.

**Inconsistent Reporting:** There might not be consistent reporting across the United States. States with large urban areas such as New York City, Chicaho, Miami, Los Angelos, may experience higher rates of gun violence possibly skewing available data.

**Legal Nuances:** Comprehending the complexities of gun laws is challenging, especially without a legal background. Analyzing gun violence data requires a broad perspective to navigate the legal landscape effectively.

**Public perception and bias:** Gun violence and gun laws are highly sensitive topics influenced by public perception and bias. Political and geographical factors can shape opinions, leading to controversies surrounding the interpretation of data. Acknowledging and addressing these biases is crucial for an objective analysis.

These factors influence the interpretation of data, requiring a nuanced understanding and objective analysis.
