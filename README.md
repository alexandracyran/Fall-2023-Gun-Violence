- Visualizations reveal patterns in the data, such as gender imbalances and the prevalence of mental health issues among shooters.

### Location Analysis

- Distribution of shootings by location type and the top 5 states with the highest number of shootings.
- Insights into the geographical patterns of shooting incidents.

### Weapon Analysis

- Word cloud analysis of weapon details, with the ability to filter by location.
- Reveals the most commonly used weapons in shooting incidents.

### Firearm Mortality Analysis

- Analysis of firearm mortality rates, deaths, and correlations.
- Visualization of mortality rates by state, year, and other relevant factors.

**Challenges/ Lessons Learned**:

Mass shootings gathers a lot of media attention, and therefore more data tracked. Making sure we differentiate between gun violence that happens every day while accounting for these specific incidents. 

There might not be consistent reporting across the United States. Some states may be more inundated by gun violence such as larger urban areas (New York-NYC, Illinois-Chicago, Florida- Miami, California).

Being able to comprehend the nuances of gun laws. We may need to look at this from a broad scope since none of us have legal backgrounds. 

Public perception and bias. No one is going to say gun violence is a good thing, but gun laws add in a level of controversy which can be influenced by political or geographical factors.
