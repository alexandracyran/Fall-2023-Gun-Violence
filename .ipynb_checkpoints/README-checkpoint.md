By: Megha Idicula, Alexandra Cyran, and Victoria Lance Kominek

---

**Overview**: Examining the relationship between people charged with gun violence and mental illness. This highlights the variations in the restrictiveness of gun laws across different states, including Connecticut. 
The question arises: Why would someone with a history of mental illness be granted a gun license?

**Background**: 

**Data Sources**:

[CDC State Firearm Mortality](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm)

[Kaggle Data Violence](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nidzsharma/us-mass-shootings-19822023/data)

[CDC State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System-SUDORS](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/dashboard/index.html#)

**Challenges/ Lessons Learned**:

Mass shootings gathers a lot of media attention, and therefore more data tracked. Making sure we differentiate between gun violence that happens every day while accounting for these specific incidents. 

There might not be consistent reporting across the United States. Some states may be more inundated by gun violence such as larger urban areas (New York-NYC, Illinois-Chicago, Florida- Miami, California).

Being able to comprehend the nuances of gun laws. We may need to look at this from a broad scope since none of us have legal backgrounds. 

Public perception and bias. No one is going to say gun violence is a good thing, but gun laws add in a level of controversy which can be influenced by political or geographical factors.
